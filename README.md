![rotating_figures_demo_gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43306816/205479189-9c8d04d8-d571-4ee2-9629-5425a5bd0de9.gif)

Simple displays uing only changing ascii characters in a python tkinter gui.
The characters used represent different levels of illumination and are selected from `.,-~:;=!*#$@`,
which are the same characters used by a guy called Andy Sloane [in this post](https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html).

## How to run

After downloading this repo, cd into the main folder and run:
```
python3 rotating_figures.py
```
The result should be a gui showing the dynamic display above.

The other script simply displays the rotating disc (without the square):
```
python3 rotating_circle.py
```
