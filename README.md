# Flat Rotating Figures

Simple displays uing only changing ascii characters in a python tkinter gui.
The characters used represent different levels of illumination and are selected from `.,-~:;=!*#$@`,
which are the same characters used by a guy called Andy Sloane [in this post](https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html).

## How to run

After downloading this repo, cd into the main folder and run:
```
python3 rotating_figures.py
```
The result should be a gui showing this dynamic display:

The other script simply displays the rotating disc (without the square):
```
python3 rotating_circle.py
```
